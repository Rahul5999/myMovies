Setting Up The Project
1.) Since we are using APIS of OMDB  we should obtain a key for accesing API data.
2.) So We will get our API key through email registration from OMDB website https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
3.) After getting the key we can get the movie details through the link like this for example https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=9e96a71f&type=movie&s=Don can get movie details of the Movie Don
4.) Now Registration of API is completed.
5.) So we need to create new Project in Xcode and suppose name it as "myMovies" and we must select include Tests
6.) Now Project is created Successfully
7.) The next step we should create splash screen that shows appLogo for 3 Seconds before navigating to the main Screen
8.) we will setup the Required UI in the ViewController of the Project , considering placing the logo in the middle of the storyboard and changing the background
9.) So UI Setting up for splash Screen is completed.Now will select new viewController from the Library and place it on the Storyboard
10.) and for that ViewController  say "MainViewController " we wil we will link that view controller through storyboard
11.) and we will place SearchBar and table view from Library and give appropiate layouts
12.) And for tableview , searchBar and Title all the modifications of code will be made mainViewController
